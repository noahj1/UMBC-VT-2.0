UMBC Virtual Tour 2.0

The goal of the UMBC Virtual Tour 2.0 Project is to dramatically improve UMBC's current virtual tour application (https://undergraduate.umbc.edu/visit/virtual-tour.php) by importing the UMBC campus map and building information into the Unity game engine, allowing users to roam freely around the university grounds from the comfort of their homes. The new system will provide a variety of usefu features, including a web interface and the ability to identify optimal parking locations and routes between classes based on user input. The system will primarily benefit prospective students who want to get a feel for the campus environment and current students, faculty, and visitors trying to find their classes or event venues and seeking the best place to park.
